#  Water Segmentation using Multispectral and optical Data
## using pretrain model and build model from scratch

Our goal is to develop a robust solution for accurately segmenting water bodies
using multispectral and optical data. This solution is vital for monitoring water
resources, flood management, and environmental conservation, where precise
segmentation of water bodies can significantly impact decision-making.
